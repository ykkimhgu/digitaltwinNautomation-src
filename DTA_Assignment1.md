## Assignment:  Pre-Processing & Feature Extraction



### Preparation

Download Template source file ([download here](https://github.com/ykkimhgu/digitaltwinNautomation-src/blob/main/Assignment/Assignment_FeatureExtraction_CWRU/DTA_Assignment_CWRU_FeatureExtraction_student.mlx))

Download small CWRU Dataset (**[download here](https://github.com/ykkimhgu/digitaltwinNautomation-src/blob/main/Assignment/Assignment_FeatureExtraction_CWRU/Assignment_FeatureExtraction_CWRU_data.zip)**)

* 1 data file for each fault state
* Normal / Outer Race fault / Inner Race fault




### Extract  and Analyze Features   

**Part 1:** 

* Time Statistical Features
* Plot FFT/PSD
* Frequency Statistical Features
* Compare analyzed features for each states



**Part 2**:

* Envelope Extraction
* Plot STFT of given signal
* Plot Spectral Kurtosis
* Plot Kurtogram
