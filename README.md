## LAB:  Bearing Fault Monitoring and RUL Estimation

### Instruction

In this LAB, you are required to create a simple code for Fault Monitoring and RUL estimation
You can refer to RUL estimation tutorial codes and related papers

### Fault Monitoring

* Detect Fault Status
* Display WARNING MESSAGE

### RUL Estimation

* Estimate RUL similar to Tutorial codes
* The end of Life can be assumed when the repair is done

### Dataset

Raw Dataset of Bearing Velocity measured that shows a Bearing Life cycle before the repair is done. Also the velocity measurement after the repair is provided.

* Bearing velocity measured 24 times per day
* Each measurement is L=8192 with Fs=2560Hz  
* Measurement for consecutive days until repair is done

# Project : PHM



## Problem 1: PHM implementation

Select an open dataset/challenge dataset, other than CWRU from the [recommended dataset list]( https://ykkim.gitbook.io/wiki/industrial-ai/phm-dataset)

* You can also choose other PHM dataset for other mechanical parts such as Gears, Battery etc
* You can choose either or both Diagnostics/Prognostics
* You will get more score if you do both Diagnosis and Prognosis
* You can use different dataset for Diagnosis and Prediction



Read related journal papers that used the selected dataset



Then, Implement Diagnose (or/and) Predict failure system in MATLAB

* You can follow the reference journal


Analyze the results and Write a Report in *.mlx 



Give a short Presentation (5min)



## Problem 2: Journal Review



Select one recent (within 5 years) PHM related journal in your interested topic. 

* This journal can be the reference journal in Problem 1
* Also, this journal study may not be related to Problem 1



Give a short Presentation on Journal Review(5min)
