# Assignment 1:  Pre-Processing & Feature Extraction



## Introduction

This assignment is implementing  'Feature Extraction' Section in the following journal paper

 

Rauber, T. W., de Assis Boldt, F., & Varejao, F. M. (2015, January). Heterogeneous Feature Models and Feature Selection Applied to Bearing Fault Diagnosis. IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).



With the given dataset, 

1. Extract and Analyze  Features and

2. Compare  Features among different bearing fault classes

   

### Preparation
