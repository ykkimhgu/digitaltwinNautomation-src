# Project 1: PHM





## Problem 1:  PHM implementation (Common dataset)

PHM with the given datasets on bearing faults.

###  Report

The file name should be **Project1-1_BearingDiagnosis_YourName.*** // for main src and report



$FILENAME=**Project1-1_BearingDiagnosis_YourName.**



Submit the report either

* (Option 1) $FILENAME$.mlx & mat files (Recommended)

* (Option 2) or $FILENAME$.md and *.mat files. 

  > When writing a report in *.md format, you have to embed the code snippets as done in *.mlx file.

Also, submit **LAB_Bearing_RUL_Prognosis_YourName.pdf** file.



## Problem 2:  PHM implementation (Opendaset)

### 1) Select an open dataset/challenge dataset

* Other than CWRU from the [recommended dataset list]( https://ykkim.gitbook.io/wiki/industrial-ai/phm-dataset)

* You can also choose other PHM datasets for other mechanical parts such as Gears, Battery etc
* You can choose either  Diagnostics or Prognostics
* You can use different datasets for Diagnosis and Prediction



### 2) Read related journal papers that used the selected dataset



### 3) Implement PHM  in MATLAB

You can follow the reference journal methods or create your own methods



### 4) Analyze the results and write the report

$FILENAME=**Project1-2_PHM_YourName **



### 5) Give a short presentation (5min)





## Problem 3: Journal Review



### 1) Select one recent (within 5 years) PHM journal paper in your interested topic. 

* This journal can be the reference journal in Problem 2

  

### 2) Give a short Presentation (<5min)





## Recommended Journal Reference
